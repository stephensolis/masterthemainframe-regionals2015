masterthemainframe-regionals2015
================================

This is the report generation code I wrote for the last challenge of the 2015
IBM Master the Mainframe Regionals (where I got 3rd place in the United States
and Canada contest!)

Instructions
------------

* I unfortunately do not have a copy of the contest data. If one were available,
you could set DB_URL, DB_USERNAME, and DB_PASSWORD at the top of finalRpt.java,
then run `make run`.
* To build the Javadoc, run `make doc`.
